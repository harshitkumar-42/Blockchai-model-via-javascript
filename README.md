# Blockchain-model-via-javascript
In this project, we will create a simple blockchain using JavaScript. A blockchain is an immutable ledger consisting of blocks that are linked together using cryptographic hashes. Each block contains a timestamp, data, hash, previous hash, nonce, and difficulty. The blocks' immutability is ensured by using a Proof-of-Work (PoW) algorithm
