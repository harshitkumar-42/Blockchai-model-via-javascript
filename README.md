# Blockchain-model-via-javascript
In this project, we will create a simple blockchain using JavaScript. A blockchain is an immutable ledger consisting of blocks that are linked together using cryptographic hashes. Each block contains a timestamp, data, hash, previous hash, nonce, and difficulty. The blocks' immutability is ensured by using a Proof-of-Work (PoW) algorithm and generating hashes with the SHA-256 algorithm.

Key Components of the Blockchain:
Timestamp: Records the exact time when the block was created.
Data: Contains the information stored in the block, which could be anything from transactions to metadata.
Hash: A unique identifier for the block, generated using the SHA-256 algorithm.
Previous Hash: The hash of the preceding block, ensuring the chain's integrity.
Nonce: A number that miners change to find a valid hash (used in the PoW algorithm).
Difficulty: Determines the complexity of the PoW algorithm, influencing how hard it is to find a valid hash.
Steps to Create the Blockchain:
Define the Block Class:

Each block will be an instance of this class.
The constructor initializes the block properties: timestamp, data, previous hash, hash, nonce, and difficulty.
The calculateHash method generates the block's hash using the SHA-256 algorithm.
The mineBlock method implements the Proof-of-Work algorithm.
Define the Blockchain Class:

The constructor initializes the blockchain with a genesis block (the first block in the chain).
The createGenesisBlock method creates the genesis block.
The getLatestBlock method returns the most recent block.
The addBlock method adds a new block to the chain after mining it.
Implementing Proof-of-Work:

In the mineBlock method, the nonce is incremented until a hash with the required difficulty (number of leading zeros) is found.
This ensures that finding a valid hash is computationally difficult, securing the blockchain.
Hash Generation with SHA-256:

The calculateHash method combines the block properties and generates a hash using the SHA-256 algorithm.
